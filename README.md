# 06-Testy

A small internet shop webapplication written in Java Script and Python FLask that has a suite of tests written with the help of Welenium and pytest.

To run this application you need to have python packages installed from the `requirements.txt` (jsonmerge, selenium, psutil, pytest and flask). Additional requirements for Browserstack are in `requirements-browserstack.txt`.

After that run the app:

`python3 ./app.py`

The webapp will appear on localhost:5000.
